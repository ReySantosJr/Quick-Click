# Quick-Click - A Personal Project
A program designed to make it easier for the user to open the apps/websites they use daily 
or frequently (labeled as “default files” in the program), and store other files, programs, 
or websites for easy access and organization. For the frequently used files that are stored, 
the user has the option to open all programs at once without opening the main program menu. 

Open the Quick Click program and all their default files will open, and a prompt will ask the 
user if they want to continue to the main menu or not, which they can select to enter the 
main menu or not. This provides easy access to files, programs, and websites.

A JAR file is provided.
